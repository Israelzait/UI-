# News App

<p>So i'm so lazy to read whole news. Just want to know what is heading and what is going on in the world. So for this i have made my own news app using flutter and free API from https://newsapi.org</p>

## Things that i have to add in future..
<p>
  i need to change many things in this app like "Pull to refresh" and add more news form more countries. And make UI look good.
